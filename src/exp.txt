I want to code a spc (statiscal process control) webpage. Here is the description. 
We have some colorful bars stacked on top of each other.

.8
    Redbar
.7
    Yellowbar
.6
    Greenbar
.5
    Greenbar
.4
    Yellowbar
.3
    Redbar
.2

The user works in a factory and is allowed to input measurement values
The user is proded via a lightbulb to make a measurement every 1 minute

The last 5 measurements are ploted on the bars.
Use SVG to connect the points with a line
